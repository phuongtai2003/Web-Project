          <p>
            Google is more than a search engine. We also offer Gmail, maps,
            personal blogging, and web-based word processing products to name
            just a few. YouTube, the popular online video service, is part of
            Google as well.<br /><br />
            Most of Google's services are free, so how do we make money? Much of
            Google's revenue comes through our AdWords advertising program,
            which allows businesses to place small “sponsored links” alongside
            our search results. Prices for these ads are set by competitive
            auctions for every search term where advertisers want their ads to
            appear. We don't sell placement in the search results themselves, or
            allow people to pay for a higher ranking there.<br /><br />
            In addition, website managers and publishers take advantage of our
            AdSense advertising program to deliver ads on their sites. This
            program generates billions of dollars in revenue each year for
            hundreds of thousands of websites, and is a major source of funding
            for the free content available across the web.
